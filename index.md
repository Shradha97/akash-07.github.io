Welcome to my homepage. My name is Akash and I have recently completed by bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering from IIT Tirupati.

## Awards

I was awarded the **President's gold medal** for the best academic performance across all branches at IIT Tirupati for my CGPA of 9.75/10.0. I was also awarded the **Institute gold medal** for standing first in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering over all four years.

Please find a short clip of the award here.  

## Internships

I have interned at [Very Large Scale Computing Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vlsc/), EPFL Switzerland where I was mentored by [Stuart Byma](https://people.epfl.ch/stuart.byma?lang=en) and [Prof. James Larus](https://people.epfl.ch/james.larus?lang=en). I worked on the optimization of cluster-merge, a scalable and precise clustering algorithm to recover significantly similar pairs among a set of elements.

Our paper titled "Parallel and scalable precise clustering for protein matching" has been submitted to PPoPP 2019.

## Interests

My broad interests lie in algorithms, deep learning and distributed systems.

#### Deep Learning

I am overwhelmed by the accuracies we have been able to achieve to several tasks starting with object detection to semantic segmentation.

In my Btech thesis, I worked on the practical implementation of face recognition for classroom attendance where we tried to bridge the gap between years of face recognition research and its utility in real world applications.
We designed an end to end framework with several optimizations for streamlined and accurate performance. The system is operation in three classrooms at IIT Tirupati. Find the video demo here.

#### Distributed systems and parallel programming

I was exposed to distributed systems during my internship at EPFL. As Moore's law ceases to hold, the only way to make systems faster is through parallel and distributed programming. I learned to reason about such systems as well as profiling them to find out easy but costly mistakes. I realised how causally writing `a = b` instead of `a = std::move(b)` can cost us minutes of computational time. My exposure at EPFL and the ever rising shift to parallel systems from traditional ones, makes me excited in this field.

## My free time

I spend my free time reading quora, medium, etc. I also like to read books though not very consistently. Following is the list of books I have read and liked.
  1. 5 Am club by Robin Sharma
  2. Rich dad poor dad
  3. One Indian girl
  4. The Alchemist
  5. Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes

I like to exercise daily and eat food full of protein.

## People I admire

1. James Larus
2. Tim Roughgarden
3. Virat Kohli
4. Naruto Uzumaki
