Welcome to my homepage. My name is Akash and I have recently completed by bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering from IIT Tirupati.

## Awards

I was awarded the **President's gold medal** for the best academic performance across all branches at IIT Tirupati for my CGPA of 9.75/10.0. I was also awarded the **Institute gold medal** for standing first in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering over all four years.

Please find a short clip of the award here.  

## Internships

I have interned at [Very Large Scale Computing Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vlsc/), EPFL Switzerland where I was mentored by [Stuart Byma](https://people.epfl.ch/stuart.byma?lang=en) and [Prof. James Larus](https://people.epfl.ch/james.larus?lang=en). I worked on the optimization of cluster-merge, a scalable and precise clustering algorithm to recover significantly similar pairs among a set of elements.

Our paper titled "Parallel and scalable precise clustering for protein matching" has been submitted to PPoPP 2019.

## Interests

My broad interests lie in algorithms, deep learning and distributed systems.

### Deep Learning

I am overwhelmed by the accuracies we have been able to achieve to several tasks starting with object detection to semantic segmentation.

In my Btech thesis, I worked on the practical implementation of face recognition for classroom attendance where we tried to bridge the gap between years of face recognition research and its utility in real world applications.
We designed an end to end framework with several optimizations for streamlined and accurate performance. The system is operation in three classrooms at IIT Tirupati. Find the video demo here.

### Distributed systems and parallel programming

Welcome to my homepage. My name is Akash and I am a Computer Science undergrad at Indian Institute Of Technology Tirupati. Algorithms, data structures, especially flow networks and graph theory interest me a lot. I also like programming in Haskell.

Two persons whom I admire the most are Tim Roughgarden and Eva Tardos. I wish to comprehend their Godel Award winning thesis. This semester, I am studying Deep Learning for Computer Vision and I'm highly intrigued by the level of accuracies we have been able to achieve in the recent years on the ImageNet Challenge.
