**Little more about me?**

Welcome to my homepage. My name is Akash and I am a Computer Science undergrad at Indian Institute Of Technology Tirupati. Algorithms, data structures, especially flow networks and graph theory interest me a lot. I also like programming in Haskell. 

Two persons whom I admire the most are Tim Roughgarden and Eva Tardos. I wish to comprehend their Godel Award winning thesis. This semester, I am studying Deep Learning for Computer Vision and I'm highly intrigued by the level of accuracies we have been able to achieve in the recent years on the ImageNet Challenge.
