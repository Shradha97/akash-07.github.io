**Little more about me?**

Welcome to my homepage. My name is Akash and I have just completed my bachelors at IIT Tirupati in Computer Science & Engineering.

## Awards

I was awarded with the President's gold medal for the best academic performance across all branches at IIT Tirupati for my CGPA of 9.75/10.0. I was also awarded the Institute gold medal for standing first in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering over all four years.

Please find a short clip of the award here.  

## Internships

I have interned at Very Large Scale Computing Lab, EPFL Switzerland where I was mentored by Stuart Byma and Prof. James Larus. I worked on optimization of cluster-merge, a scalable and precise clustering algorithm to recover significantly similar pairs among a set of elements.

Our paper titled "Parallel and scalable precise clustering for protein matching." has been submitted to PPoPP 2019.

## Interests

My broad interests lie in algorithms, deep learning and distributed systems.

Welcome to my homepage. My name is Akash and I am a Computer Science undergrad at Indian Institute Of Technology Tirupati. Algorithms, data structures, especially flow networks and graph theory interest me a lot. I also like programming in Haskell.

Two persons whom I admire the most are Tim Roughgarden and Eva Tardos. I wish to comprehend their Godel Award winning thesis. This semester, I am studying Deep Learning for Computer Vision and I'm highly intrigued by the level of accuracies we have been able to achieve in the recent years on the ImageNet Challenge.
